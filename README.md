# Database-Server
Final project for my entry UNIX class.

This project was an assignment to be ran on my university's servers. The purpose of the project was to allow the server to host on an open port and have multiple clients enter the server and push request-reply messages through the use of multithreading.

Yes, I realize I don't have comments. This appears to be an older version of my file prior to submission where I had cleared the comments, but maybe I'll find that final copy with the comments some day.
